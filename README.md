# Hubot

This is a version of GitHub's Campfire bot, hubot. He's pretty cool.

**You'll probably never have to hack on this repo directly.**

Instead this repo provides a library that's distributed by `npm` that you
simply require in your project. Follow the instructions below and get your own
hubot ready to deploy.

## Getting your own

Make sure you have [node.js][nodejs] and [npm][npmjs] (npm comes with node v0.6.5+) installed.

Download the [latest version of hubot][hubot-latest].

Then follow the instructions in the [README][readme] in the extracted `hubot`
directory.
